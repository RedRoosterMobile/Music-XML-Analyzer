# Music XML Analyzer
Music XML Analyzer is a tool to analyze music xml data.

## Abstract
The user should be able to upload music xml files to set his corpus. These files are analysed (counting notes, show distributions for intervals, etc.) and the results are displayed in understandable way.  
The user should be able to search for specific patterns in his corpus. The search input should be intuitive for professionals with sheet music as well as for beginners with notes. The search results should be displayed in a list, where the user can view a specific occurence of his pattern. The user should also be able to play the result extract.
